## ğŸš€ Overview

**ML-Master** is a novel AI4AI (AI-for-AI) agent that integrates exploration and reasoning into a coherent iterative methodology, facilitated by an adaptive memory mechanism that selectively captures and summarizes relevant insights and outcomes, ensuring each component mutually reinforces the other without compromising either.
